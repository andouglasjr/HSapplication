# Knowing the System

The HolSys-ML is able to acquire holographic images of water samples using a holographic system, make the reconstruction using a web application or any numerical tool, and perform the classification using Deep Learning models. The system is shown in the image below.

The distances between the components are the main point in the system setup. As this system was thought to be used mainly in scientific proposes, an important characteristic that is important to highlight is the ability to change the position of the components easily, making it adaptable relying on the application. Besides that, it is possible to adapt the system to be used to different samples size or to improve the acquired hologram by making little changes in these distances.

This system is composed by optical and structural components. The firsts, when correctly placed, generate the hologram in the camera plane, whereas the other allow the movement of the optical components in the configuration step. The optical and structural components used to build this system are detailed in the section [Components](components.html). Some of these components are build in a 3D printer and are detailed in the section [3D Design](3d_design.html).
