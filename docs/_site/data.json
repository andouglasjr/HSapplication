The system was designed to be used by scientists and researches in order to make easier the studies of particles using holography techniques and deep learning trained models. In this page is detailed all the steps to build a HolSys and it is available the Web Application developed to work with the system to perform all need steps to reconstruct the hologram and classify it using ML.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"holsys-hardware\">HolSys Hardware</h2>\n\n<p>The holographic system is composed by optical and structural components that have been designed to make the setup easier for different sort of applications. All the documentation to clone the HolSys is detailed <a href=\"\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hswebapp\">HSWebApp</h2>\n\n<p>The HSWebApp was developed to be used with the HolSys but can be used for any holographic device that acquire the hologram using a digital camera. This application is able to make the follow steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: The device camera plugged in the computer is accessed directly by the browser and the hologram can be acquired and uploaded to the server. It is also possible to use acquired holograms saved in the “/saved_holograms” folder. In this case, .png, .jpeg, and .bmp images and .mat file are supported.</li>\n <li><strong>Processing</strong>: In this step is possible to apply some image filters, like bright and contrast, to improve the fringes partners.</li>\n <li><strong>Reconstruction</strong>: Once the hologram was acquired and processed, it is possible to make its reconstruction with pixel size, wavelength and plane Z range parameters. Besides that, to off-axis setup, a manual spatial filter can be applied to isolate only the real image for the reconstruction. The reconstruction step realizes the propagation (using the HoloPy library modified) and the autofocusing using Tamura Coefficient technique and return the intensity and phase of the reconstructed hologram.</li>\n <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Depending on how the samples is disposed in the image, it is necessary to perform the separation to be inserting on the machine learning model. This is performed using Otsu algorithm and image fill.</li>\n <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: In this last step, the user can upload some ML models and use it to classify the test samples for their application. More than one model can be used in a ensemble model approach.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The web application codes are available on <a href=\"\">github</a>.

The system is shown in the image below.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/image_system.jpg\" width=\"200\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>The distances between the components are the main point in the system setup. As this system was thought to be used mainly in scientific proposes, an important characteristic that is important to highlight is the ability to change the position of the components easily, making it adaptable relying on the application. Besides that, it is possible to adapt the system to be used to different samples size or to improve the acquired hologram by making little changes in these distances.</p>\n\n<p>This system is composed by optical and structural components. The firsts, when correctly placed, generate the hologram in the camera plane, whereas the other allow the movement of the optical components in the configuration step.
