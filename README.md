## Holographic System to Identify and Classify Mircoparticles in Water Samples

The HSApplication is a holographic system + web application developed by Andouglas Junior of NatalnetLab Network in paternership to ISASI-Italy. It is used to indentify and classify microparticles in water samples using holography and deep learning. The system hardware is composed by optical and structural components that make easier the setup of the interferometric approach, whereas the software is a web application able to realize acquisition, processing, reconstruction, segmentation and classification steps. This page show a step-by-step tutorial teaching how to make the same holographic system with the optical components list, structure and setup.
